# Model Brief: 3D Vision Transformer for Field Boundary Delineation

This repository hosts the implementation of a 3D Vision Transformer designed for efficient field boundary delineation using time series satellite imagery. The model leverages spatio-temporal correlations to improve accuracy and robustness, particularly in challenging conditions such as partial cloud cover.

## Key Features:
- **3D Vision Transformer Architecture**: Adapted for handling time series data, the model processes either Sentinel-2 (S2) optical imagery or Sentinel-1 (S1) SAR data, or a combination of both, through a memory-efficient attention mechanism.
- **Handling Cloud Contamination**: The model is capable of extracting field boundaries even from cloud-contaminated imagery by leveraging S2 time series. For dense cloud coverage, the model effectively switches to S1 data, which is unaffected by clouds.
- **Dual Implementation**: The repository provides two models: 
  - **PTAViT3D**: Processes either S2 or S1 time series independently.
  - **PTAViT3D-CA**: A cross-attention model designed for fusing S2 and S1 time series data.
- **High-Resolution Predictions**: When trained on S1 inputs, the model achieves spatial resolution comparable to S2 (10m), offering precise boundary delineation.
- **Extensive Coverage**: Demonstrated on the large-scale agricultural area in Australia, showcasing the model's scalability and efficiency.

## Software envinment    
Container ready for use can be found on      
+ NVIDIA: docker pull fdiakogiannis/trchprosthesis_requirements:24.07-py3



## Model forward 
We provide demo notebooks that show how the models, PTAViT3D and PTAViT3D-CA can be used (demo forward). Please see the [ssg2](https://github.com/feevos/ssg2) repository for further details on RocksDB dataset creation and additional information. We recommend using the dataset [ai4boundaries](https://github.com/waldnerf/ai4boundaries/tree/main) for your experiments, that provides time series of Sentinel2 images and corresponding ground truth labels. 



## A song too?   
In the era of AI, we decided to make a song for our paper using suno. You can listen to it [here](https://suno.com/song/3ff72217-2a85-4af2-87d5-9f5b50c9c68c).

## Lyrics
**Verse 1**
Fluffy clouds up in the sky  
Drawing maps from way up high  
Boundaries in the field we find  
With time and space we're intertwined  

**Verse 2**
Satellite's eye sees far and wide  
SAR and S2A both provide  
Imagery that guides our way  
To detect the lines we survey  

**Chorus**
Oh fluffy clouds they show the route  
Through fields where patterns sprout  
With every image scanned and seen  
We paint the picture on the screen  

**Verse 3**
In the fields the borders blur  
Technology makes them clearer  
In the waves and colors found  
We trace the lines upon the ground  

**Verse 4**
From the skies we gather clues  
Through the earth's ever-changing hues  
Data streams like melodies  
Unlock the secrets of the trees  

**Bridge**
Oh the future's looking bright  
With every satellite in flight  
Mapping out the earth below  
In fields of green and golden glow
